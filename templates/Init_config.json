If square, lon_0/lat_0 is the beach northern point and lon_1/lat_1 the southern point of the beach. If disk, lon_0/lat_0 is the center of the circle, and lon_1/lat1 also (repetition needed). If rectangle, a rectangle will be drawn based on a line between 2 points. lon_0/lat_0 is the northern point of the line and lon_1/lat1 the southern point. If beach (=beach start), find closest cell from beach.",
